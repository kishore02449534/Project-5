We use the SMS Spam Collection Dataset, which contains 5,572 messages labeled as "spam" or "ham."
suitable for this project as it includes a balanced set of labeled messages for both classes.
Why we choose this dataset is because clean with no missing values, and each message is associated with a corresponding label indicating whether it is spam or not.

Text to Numbers: SMS messages are converted into numerical data using CountVectorizer, which creates a "bag-of-words" representation for the Naive Bayes classifier to understand.

analysis technique : We use the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, which is appropriate for text data
Why Naive Bayes Works for Text: This method is good at classifying text because it looks at how often words appear in messages, which helps tell the difference between spam and ham.


In this project, we Split the data into a training set (80%) and a testing set (20%) to evaluate model performance.
Multinomial Naive Bayes is suitable for this task because it has shown strong performance in text classification, particularly when handling word frequencies.
